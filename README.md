### Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room was an electronic gaming service, that had a fun game offered via the Android Play Store. They reached out to us to expand their current offerings, to include both iOS and web users as well. Increasing the user base comes with required infrastructure improvements, involving chnages to both the server and client sides of the program.

### What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
While I believe I met all the requirements, I particularly excelled at optimzing the infrastrucre relebvbant to the gaming room server. The entire game relies on the server, and if it goes down, no one can play. An event like this can break years of user trust, and come with serious business consequences. This is why I spent extra time wokring on reliabiliaty, redundancy, and performance. From the database, to the hub and spoke implementation, The Game Room can expect a top-notch deliverable.

### What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Having a reference point to act as a guide is incredibly helpeful when developing such a large and complex project like this. When developing large scale projects, it's important to focus on small, digestable pieces at a time. By utiliting a design document, you can accomplish two very valuable things. First, you can break apart the project, into those small digestable chunks. Then,you can focus on defining each chunk, one by one. This allows you to "stay light" when your developing, and just focus on writing readbale, optimized code.

### If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would probaby revise the database aspect of The Gaming Room. Databases can range from very small to very large, and can be structured an infinute amount of ways. While this was not part of the assignemnts scope, if I could go back and spend more time on one part of this project, I believe the most amount of potential is located here.

### How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
When discussing software, there are hardly any situations, if any, where the user isn't the most important perspective to consider. In this design document I was able to consider all four users: admin, iOS, android, and web, and consider what each needs to have a spectacular experience.

### How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
For me, I used a top down approach to design this software. I first designed a system from a very high level, and then continued doing so, with each iteration getting a little more detailed. I did this until I had a sufficently defined system, that I felt answered all the various requirements and answers. In the futre, I will defintely do the same thing. I found this to be incredibly efficient, and allows you to understand very large systems from all the different levels, low to high.
